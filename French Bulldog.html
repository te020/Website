	  <p>	The origin of the modern French Bulldog breed descends directly from the dogs of the Molossians, an ancient Greek tribe.
	 	The dogs were spread throughout the ancient world by Phoenician traders. British Molossian dogs were developed into the English Mastiff, 
		a sub-breed of the Mastiff was the Bullenbeisser, a type of dog used for bull-baiting.

		Blood sports such as bull-baiting were outlawed in England in 1835, leaving these "Bulldogs" unemployed; however, they had been bred for 
		non-sporting reasons since at least 1800, so their use changed from a sporting breed to a companion breed. To reduce their size, some Bulldogs
		were crossed with terriers, ratter dogs from the "slums" of England. By 1850, the Toy Bulldog had become common in England and appeared in 
		conformation shows when they began around 1860.[citation needed] These dogs weighed around 16–25 pounds (7.3–11.3 kg), although classes were 
		also available at dog shows for those who weighed under 12 pounds (5.4 kg).

		At the same time, lace workers from Nottingham, displaced by the Industrial Revolution, began to settle in Normandy, France. They brought a 
		variety of dogs with them, including Toy Bulldogs.[9] The dogs became popular in France and a trade in imported small Bulldogs was created, 
		with breeders in England sending over Bulldogs that they considered to be too small, or with faults such as ears that stood up. By 1860, there were 
		few Toy Bulldogs left in England, such was their popularity in France and due to the exploits of specialist dog exporters.

		The small Bulldog type gradually became thought of as a breed, and received a name, the Bouledogue Francais. This Francization of the English name 
		is also a contraction of the words boule (ball) and dogue (mastiff or molosser). The dogs were highly fashionable and were sought after by society 
		ladies and Parisian prostitutes alike, as well as creatives such as artists, writers, and fashion designers.[10] However, records were not kept of the 
		breed's development as it diverged further away from its original Bulldog roots. As it changed, terrier stock had been brought in to develop traits such 
		as the breed's long straight ears.
